# TODO

##### Core
* Enable two player mode
* Game engine and score persistence

##### Sound effects
* Alien's movement sfx is missing
* Mystery ship's cruising sound is continuous, event after it goes off focus
* Alien's movement sfx should speed up upon alien being hit
* Alien's decent sfx is missing

##### Animation effects
* Left to right screen wiping of aliens' mesh
* Slow initial drawing of aliens (one by one)
* Step by step movement of aliens

##### Miscellaneous
* Score should not be reset at each new wave
* Alien missiles should be of three different types with different distinct graphics
* Show "Game Over" string on death of laser cannon at top center of screen in capital
  (HINT: OnStopGame intro screen)
* When a player shoots an alien, the alien's horizontal speed should increase
* Bunker should forgo random debris mutation with radius of 1px around MISSILE_RECT collision
* AI regarding alien missiles is wrong (not matching original arcade game behaviour)
