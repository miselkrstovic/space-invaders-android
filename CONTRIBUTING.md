Contributing
----------------------------------
1. File an issue to notify the maintainers about what you're working on.
2. Fork the repo, develop and test your code changes, add docs.
3. Make sure that your commit messages clearly describe the changes.
4. Send a pull request.

File an Issue
----------------------------------
Use the issue tracker to start the discussion. It is possible that someone
else is already working on your idea, your approach is not quite right, or that
the functionality exists already. The ticket you file in the issue tracker will
be used to hash that all out.

Style Guides
-------------------
Try to follow the coding style that is defined in the following resources:
* [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
* [AOSP Java Code Style for Contributors](https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/code-style).

Fork the Repository
-------------------
Be sure to add the relevant tests before making the pull request. Docs will be
updated automatically when we merge to `master`, but you should also build
the docs yourself and make sure they're readable.

Make the Pull Request
---------------------
Once you have made all your changes, tests, and updated the documentation,
make a pull request to move everything back into the main branch of the
`repository`. Be sure to reference the original issue in the pull request.
Expect some back-and-forth with regards to style and compliance of these
rules.
